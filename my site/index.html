           <h3>Studying International Project Management</h3>
           <p>I began studying International Project Management in 2019 at the University of Applied Sciences Munich and fell in love with it ever since then.
              As part of my studies, I acquired very versatile skills and knowledge in the field of project management, beginning with all fundamental knowledge in business administration and economics,
               economics in international comparison, economic mathematics and international contract law as well as political and social science topics such as international economic relations, empirical social research and
                intercultural communication and last but not least,the core topic of my studies - International Project Management.

           <h3>Web Development and Web Design</h3>
           <p>I recently dicovered a new passion in Web Development and Web Design. I love the connection of creative work and the state of focus I achieve when learning and writing code in my free time.
           It is the perfect combination between artistic and analytical work and is one of the most rewarding
           things to do – after all, isn´t it nice to have something beautiful and at the same time so useful like a well designed website? </p>

           <h3>Dancing and teaching</h3>
           <p>I started competitive latin american dancing when I was around the age of seven and only stopped when I reached my 20s. Dancing is definitely one of the major aspects that defined who I am today.
              Not only is it one of the most beautiful arts I know, it teaches you how to take on responsibility in a team, push beyond your limits and how to work hard for something you really want, it
              also allowed me to see and visit many places around the world when traveling to international competitions auch as Italy, Latvia, Norway, Poland and so many more!
              In 2016 I also began teaching and mentoring young aspiring dancers, which was a beautiful experience – I love seeing them improve and enjoy the amazing art of dancing.</p>

           <h3>Languages</h3>
           <p class="quote"> "Knowledge of languages is the doorway to wisdom." – Roger Bacon</p>
           I have a passion for languages, especially English since the UK has become pretty much my second home.
           I was lucky to have had brilliant teachers who tought me all the basics in Italian, French and especially Spanish.
           Additionally to these romance languages I am currently working on my Russian as well to dive into the slavic language area.
           My dream is to work internationally, to get to know new exciting cultures and to get the chance to apply my language skills in real life.

           <h3>Chess and puzzle solving</h3>
           Many say chess is boring – to me it is one of the most exciting and challenging arts to master.
           The way of thinking needed to succesfully conquer and win a game of chess doesn´t only help you on the board, but also in life. As Benjamin Franklin once said:
           “Chess teaches foresight, by having to plan ahead; vigilance, by having to keep watch over the whole chess board; caution, by having to restrain ourselves from making hasty moves;
            and finally, we learn from chess the greatest maxim in life – that even when everything seems to be going badly for us we should not lose heart, but always hoping for a change for the better,
             steadfastly continue searching for the solutions to our problems.”

           <h3>Art and Design</h3>
           <p>Art has always been a important constant throughout my life.
             It has always been my way form of meditation – it gave me the chance to relax and unwind while working on my next piece of art.
             I enjoy the process of creating something new and developing my own style and design.
